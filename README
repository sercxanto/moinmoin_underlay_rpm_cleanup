moinmoin_underlay_rpm_cleanup

Cleans entries in MoinMoin's underlay dir not found in rpm listing

MoinMoin stores its SystemPages or HelpPages in a so called underlay directory
(see data_underlay_dir in wikiconfig.py). The basic idea is to be able to
seperate the content of the wiki from its auxilliary pages. And you can also
share the (readonly) underlay between different wiki instances on one server.

Those pages are language dependend. In the standard source / RPM of versions <
1.9 only english is included. So if you want to provide localized system pages
to your users you have to call the SystemPagesSetup wiki page to install the
language pack like described in the MoinMoin wiki.

As the language packs are also installed in the underlay directory it could
happen that after some time the whole directory is messed up with a mixture of
files that came from rpm and language packs that were installed manually. To
make it even worser it is not guaranteed that old versions of language packs
are cleanly removed when installing a new one.

Starting with 1.9 MoinMoin does not even include the english version, so you
definitely have to visit SystemPagesSetup after installation. But at least
there will be no confusion between rpm / no rpm based files in future.

Anyway if you stay with version 1.8 it is wise to clean up the underlay data
dir after an update and re-install any language you want to have. For this
purpose I wrote this script.

It cleans up files in /usr/share/moin/underlay which are not found in file
listing of the moin rpm package.

Just call moinmoin_underlay_rpm_cleanup.py to see which files would be deleted.
To actually delete files append the -d option to it.
